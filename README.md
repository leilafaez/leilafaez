I am Leila, an accomplished FullStack developer with nearly a decade of experience in the software industry. Throughout my career, I have worn multiple hats, including roles as a Scrum Master and System Analyst, consistently delivering optimal results for the companies I've had the privilege to work with.🙋

My passion lies in creating intuitive and scalable web applications. I have extensive experience managing projects from concept to deployment, thriving in collaborative environments, and dedicating myself to delivering solutions that align seamlessly with user and business needs.

Previously, I excelled as a Scrum Master and adept software analyst. However, my fervent passion led me to pursue a FullStack developer role after successfully completing renowned courses at the esteemed "𝘾𝙤𝙙𝙚𝙔𝙤𝙪𝙧𝙁𝙪𝙩𝙪𝙧𝙚" Institute.🎯💥
